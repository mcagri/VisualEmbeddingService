# Visual Embeddings
Image embedding generation service based on the publication [CoCa: Contrastive Captioners are Image-Text
Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01917.pdf).
Very strong image-to-text model, capable of generating captions for images. Further investigation on the model will be handled in upcoming projects.
